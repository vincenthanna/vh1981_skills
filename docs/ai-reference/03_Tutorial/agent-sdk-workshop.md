Agent SDK Workshop
Hands-on workshop materials for building production agents with the Claude Agent SDK.
No code writing required. You flip switches, pick from component lists, and write prompts. The SDK does the rest.

Quick start
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone <repo-url> agent-sdk-workshop
cd agent-sdk-workshop

# 2. Install (Python 3.10+)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set your API key
cp .env.example .env
# → edit .env and paste your key after ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# 4. Verify everything works
./workshop check
#   (on Windows: python workshop check)

# 5. Run the first exercise
./workshop demo

Structure
01-guided-demo/    One agent, four stages. Flip switches in config.py, re-run, watch it improve.
02-breakouts/      Pick a use case. Assemble an agent from pre-built tools and sub-agents.
extend/            Finished early? Recipes for adding your own tools, sub-agents, and breakouts.
docs/              Cheat sheet, FAQ, troubleshooting.

The ./workshop command
One entry point for everything:

Command
Does

./workshop check
Verify your setup before starting (Python version, API key, SDK)

./workshop demo
Run the guided demo agent

./workshop demo --show-prompt
See the full context the SDK is sending to the model

./workshop breakout
List available breakouts

./workshop breakout <name>
Run a specific breakout

./workshop reset
Clear all memory files (fresh start)

On Windows, prefix with python: python workshop check.

Part 1 — Guided demo
One agent. One task. Four runs. Between each run, flip one switch in config.py and watch the agent get better at the same job.

Stage
Toggle
SDK primitive
What unlocks

0
(all off)
system_prompt
Just chat — no tools, no state

1
ENABLE_TOOLS
@tool + mcp_servers
Agent can look things up

2
ENABLE_SUBAGENTS
AgentDefinition + Task tool
Agent delegates to specialists

3
ENABLE_MEMORY
hooks + a persistence tool
Agent remembers across restarts

→ Open 01-guided-demo/GUIDE.md for the stage-by-stage walkthrough.

Part 2 — Breakouts
Pick a use case. Assemble an agent. You get a library of pre-built tools (6 categories, 19 tools) and 6 sub-agents. Each breakout's config.py is where you pick which to enable and write the system prompt.

Breakout
Scenario

00-warmup
Same briefing task from the demo, but assembled the breakout way

chief-of-staff
Board meeting prep, email drafting, exec briefings

customer-support
Ticket triage with KB-grounded responses

sre-agent
Incident investigation — correlate deploys, metrics, runbooks

account-intelligence
Pre-renewal account review — surface hidden churn risks

freeform
Blank canvas — you have your own use case

→ Open 02-breakouts/README.md to pick one.

Requirements

Python 3.10+ (the SDK uses modern type syntax)
An Anthropic API key
That's it. Every tool is backed by local mock data — no external services, no extra credentials.

If something breaks

Run ./workshop check — catches most setup issues
Check docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md
