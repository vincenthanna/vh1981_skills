Claude Code Action
A general-purpose Claude Code action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry.
Features

🎯 Intelligent Mode Detection: Automatically selects the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow context—no configuration needed
🤖 Interactive Code Assistant: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
🔍 Code Review: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
✨ Code Implementation: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
💬 PR/Issue Integration: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
🛠️ Flexible Tool Access: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
📋 Progress Tracking: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
📊 Structured Outputs: Get validated JSON results that automatically become GitHub Action outputs for complex automations
🏃 Runs on Your Infrastructure: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)
⚙️ Simplified Configuration: Unified prompt and claude_args inputs provide clean, powerful configuration aligned with Claude Code SDK

📦 Upgrading from v0.x?
See our Migration Guide for step-by-step instructions on updating your workflows to v1.0. The new version simplifies configuration while maintaining compatibility with most existing setups.
Quickstart
The easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run /install-github-app.
This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.
Note:

You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. For AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, or Microsoft Foundry setup, see docs/cloud-providers.md.
