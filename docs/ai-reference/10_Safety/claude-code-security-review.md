Claude Code Security Reviewer
An AI-powered security review GitHub Action using Claude to analyze code changes for security vulnerabilities. This action provides intelligent, context-aware security analysis for pull requests using Anthropic's Claude Code tool for deep semantic security analysis. See our blog post here for more details.
Features

AI-Powered Analysis: Uses Claude's advanced reasoning to detect security vulnerabilities with deep semantic understanding
Diff-Aware Scanning: For PRs, only analyzes changed files
PR Comments: Automatically comments on PRs with security findings
Contextual Understanding: Goes beyond pattern matching to understand code semantics
Language Agnostic: Works with any programming language
False Positive Filtering: Advanced filtering to reduce noise and focus on real vulnerabilities

Quick Start
Add this to your repository's .github/workflows/security.yml:
name: Security Review

permissions:
  pull-requests: write  # Needed for leaving PR comments
  contents: read

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha || github.sha }}
          fetch-depth: 2
      
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-security-review@main
        with:
          comment-pr: true
          claude-api-key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY }}
Security Considerations
This action is not hardened against prompt injection attacks and should only be used to review trusted PRs. We recommend configuring your repository to use the "Require approval for all external contributors" option to ensure workflows only run after a maintainer has reviewed the PR.

Workflow

PR Analysis: When a pull request is opened, Claude analyzes the diff to understand what changed
Contextual Review: Claude examines the code changes in context, understanding the purpose and potential security implications
Finding Generation: Security issues are identified with detailed explanations, severity ratings, and remediation guidance
False Positive Filtering: Advanced filtering removes low-impact or false positive prone findings to reduce noise
PR Comments: Findings are posted as review comments on the specific lines of code

Security Analysis Capabilities
Types of Vulnerabilities Detected

Injection Attacks: SQL injection, command injection, LDAP injection, XPath injection, NoSQL injection, XXE
Authentication & Authorization: Broken authentication, privilege escalation, insecure direct object references, bypass logic, session flaws
Data Exposure: Hardcoded secrets, sensitive data logging, information disclosure, PII handling violations
Cryptographic Issues: Weak algorithms, improper key management, insecure random number generation
Input Validation: Missing validation, improper sanitization, buffer overflows
Business Logic Flaws: Race conditions, time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) issues
Configuration Security: Insecure defaults, missing security headers, permissive CORS
Supply Chain: Vulnerable dependencies, typosquatting risks
Code Execution: RCE via deserialization, pickle injection, eval injection
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS

False Positive Filtering
The tool automatically excludes a variety of low-impact and false positive prone findings to focus on high-impact vulnerabilities:

Denial of Service vulnerabilities
Rate limiting concerns
Memory/CPU exhaustion issues
Generic input validation without proven impact
Open redirect vulnerabilities

The false positive filtering can also be tuned as needed for a given project's security goals.
Benefits Over Traditional SAST

Contextual Understanding: Understands code semantics and intent, not just patterns
Lower False Positives: AI-powered analysis reduces noise by understanding when code is actually vulnerable
Detailed Explanations: Provides clear explanations of why something is a vulnerability and how to fix it
Adaptive Learning: Can be customized with organization-specific security requirements

Installation & Setup
GitHub Actions
Follow the Quick Start guide above. The action handles all dependencies automatically.
Local Development
To run the security scanner locally against a specific PR, see the evaluation framework documentation.

Claude Code Integration: /security-review Command
By default, Claude Code ships a /security-review slash command that provides the same security analysis capabilities as the GitHub Action workflow, but integrated directly into your Claude Code development environment. To use this, simply run /security-review to perform a comprehensive security review of all pending changes.
Customizing the Command
The default /security-review command is designed to work well in most cases, but it can also be customized based on your specific security needs. To do so:

Copy the security-review.md file from this repository to your project's .claude/commands/ folder.
Edit security-review.md to customize the security analysis. For example, you could add additional organization-specific directions to the false positive filtering instructions.

Custom Scanning Configuration
It is also possible to configure custom scanning and false positive filtering instructions, see the docs/ folder for more details.
Testing
Run the test suite to validate functionality:
cd claude-code-security-review
# Run all tests
pytest claudecode -v
